📖 Overview:

This project is a simple TCP-based client-server application integrated with a modern Flask web interface. It simulates a feedback system where:

A TCP client sends a request to a TCP server.

The server replies with an HTTP-like response.

Users submit feedback via a responsive web form.

All feedback is stored in a JSON file and can be viewed, edited, or deleted dynamically through the UI.

This project was built as part of a Computer Networks course to demonstrate the integration of socket programming with web technologies.
